        Line Chart: Housing Price Trends:
        This charts helps visualize how housing affordability has changed over time in Dallas. You can compare 2 different data sources:
        - Traditional Housing Price Index data
            - measure of how home value change over time. It doesn't show actual dollar prices of houses, instead it shows how much prices have increased of decreased compared to a starting point.
            - index is based on 100 in a baseline year (2005) - approx $149,100
            - an index of 150 means home prices have increased by 50% since 2005 - approx $223,650
            - an index of 250 means home prices have decreased by 150% since 2005 - approx $372,750
        - Median Household Income (from FRED)
        
        WHY only housing and income trends for capital expenses? 
        
            Due to dataset constraints and the interest of creating a focused narrative, this dashboard emphasizes housing as the primary capital expense. Future versions could include transportation or education indices as additional capital expenses over time. 
        
        These insights help show the gap between wages and expenses - a key part in understanding affordability in urban areas such as the great Dallas. 
        
        Why this matters: 
        This tab serves mostly as educational. It helps you:
            - Understand the building blocks of monthly living expenses.
